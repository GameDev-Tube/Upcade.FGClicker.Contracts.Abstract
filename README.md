# Upcade.FGClicker.Score

Solidity smart contract for Fea&Greed: Pepenade Crush minigame, that allows players to store their high scores on the blockchain.
It uses `@openzeppelin`'s EIP-712 implementation to provide a safe way for users to store backend-validated data.
The contract is UUPS upgradeable.
